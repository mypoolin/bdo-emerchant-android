# Getting Started
Currently, there is no online channel for merchants to register as a BDO Pay merchant. By developing a mobile
application, we shall enable online application for both existing and potential partners wherein applicants may provide their
information and submit required documents through the mobile app. Through this same mobile app, the merchant shall get
an instanteous response to his application status inquiry.

# Prerequisites
